Japanese Radicals font
-----------
Derived from [Source Han Sans](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-han-sans), _Japanese Radicals_ is a small (54KB), custom font (_JapaneseRadicals-Regular.otf_) with full support all Japanese radicals and their variants (322 characters). EOT and WOFF versions of the font can be found in the "webfonts" sub-directory.

To improve compatability with legacy encodings in existing files _Japanese Radicals_ includes all the glyphs in the Unicode Kangxi Radicals (U+2F00..U+2FDF) and CJK Radicals Supplement (U+2E80..U+2EFF) character ranges as well as a small number of Han ideographs. The remaining 60 radical glyphs not available in Unicode were encoded in the Private Use Area range U+E700..U+E759. 

Also included are PDF and CSV files which show the radicals present in the font, their encodings, stroke numbers, meanings, readings and positions. A PNG image illustrates the 60 custom glyphs added by us. It can be [viewed in use on the _Kanji alive_ website](http://kanjialive.com/214-traditional-kanji-radicals/). _Japanese Radicals_ is freely available for private or commercial use under an [Apache 2.0](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/) license granted by Adobe.
